## Piotr Betkier

I'm a software engineer with 6+ years of professional experience. My passion is
building useful tools and reliable systems.

I used to be active in the Warsaw IT community. I co-organised
[PyWaw](http://pywaw.org/) meetups for a few years and co-organised
[PyWaw Summit](http://summit.pywaw.org/2015/) conference.

Currently I develop the technical platform of [Allegro](https://allegro.pl).
